## Library

**Essential Utilities:**
- **serde** - The go-to library for serialization/deserialization. Works seamlessly with JSON, YAML, TOML, and more
- **tokio** - The most popular async runtime for building concurrent applications
- **clap** - Fantastic command-line argument parser with derive macros for easy CLI creation
- **anyhow** - Simplifies error handling with flexible error types

**Web Development:**
- **axum** - Modern, ergonomic web framework built on tokio and hyper
- **reqwest** - HTTP client that's easy to use for making API calls
- **sqlx** - Async SQL toolkit with compile-time checked queries

**Data Processing:**
- **polars** - Lightning-fast DataFrame library, great alternative to pandas
- **csv** - Robust CSV reading/writing with good performance
- **regex** - Perl-compatible regular expressions

**System Programming:**
- **crossbeam** - Advanced concurrency primitives beyond what std provides
- **rayon** - Data parallelism library for easy parallel iterators
- **mio** - Low-level async I/O primitives

**Development Tools:**
- **tracing** - Structured logging and diagnostics
- **criterion** - Statistical benchmarking framework

What type of project are you working on? I can give more targeted recommendations based on your specific needs - whether it's web services, CLI tools, data processing, systems programming, or something else entirely.
